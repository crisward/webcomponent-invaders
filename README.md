# Hyper-Coffee

Called this because I started messing with coffeescript with hyperHTML.
However this evolved into using Haunted, with lit-html....
Basically a super small framework, mixing some new ideas together to build very simple webcomponents.
Also using roll-up, well why not?

## What's Good

* Shadow DOM
* Re-usable
* Simple State Model
* Very small when bundled
* Composable - compoents in components

## What's Bad
* Lacking ways to easily communicate between components
* Very young
* Much smaller audience (bit like riot)

## Using

```
npm install
npm run build
open index.html
```

Use `npm run watch` to re-build while changing
