# Invaders

A quick mess with webcomponents, using lit-html / lit-element. Just a recreation of classic space-invaders.

Seems pretty quick. Only very basic functionality in place, but proves rendering is reasonably performant. Based on a vanilla js version I did of this (see index.1.html).

## Using

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
open index.html
```

Use `npm run watch` to re-build while changing
